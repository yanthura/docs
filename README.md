# Yanthura docs made by GitHub pages

## This to remember when `docs.yanthura.com` not worked
1. Create an empty `.nojekyll` file in root folder in remote git repo
2. `CNAME` must be existed in root folder with the domain `docs.yanthura.com`
3. Domain must be added to your GitHub pages settings
4. In `package.json`, you must add `"homepage": "https://docs.yanthura.com",` this line
